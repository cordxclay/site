We are two sisters who live in different countries, but have always loved creating things together. Our fiber art is hand-woven by Elisa in Singapore, and our pottery is made by Evelyn in San Francisco. 

Nothing is outsourced - we design all of our products and create them by hand, in small batches or as one-off pieces.
