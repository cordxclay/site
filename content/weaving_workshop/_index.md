In this workshop, Elisa teaches basic techniques which will enable you to create your own unique wall weaving from start to finish. The lesson will guide you through a sample pattern, but you will be free to pick your own colour palette and materials, as well as make your own specific design choices as you go. Enjoy the process of organic creation, and see where it leads you!
